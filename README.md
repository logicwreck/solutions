1) About.

This is a simple python script made to parse the squid log file and update the mysql database configured for this with the traffic used on per user bases. If the traffic limit is fully used then
the user is blocked. Also it can reset the traffic used when needed(usually on monthly bases). The script is optimized and the tests show that it can pars a 1 GB log file in 26-30 seconds on a
pretty slow-speed machine(only 2 GB RAM and a AMD Athlon(tm) II X2 220 Processor) with and IDE drive.

2) Requirements.

Python version 3.2.x with the pymysql package installed.
Squid installed with the ability to connect to the mysql database.

3) Installation.

First get the package from git:

git clone https://logicwreck@github.com/logicwreck/solutions.git -b squid_counter

Assuming that squid was installed under /usr/local/squid/, and python version 3.2 under /usr/local/bin/python3.2 the next steps will need to be taken:
 
 a) Put the squid db auth script(squid_db_auth) into the squid libexec directory, in this case it will be /usr/local/squid/libexec
 
 b) Put the squid configuration(squid.conf) into the /usr/local/squid/etc/ directory(or another directory that is used as the squid config directory)
 
 c) Create a database in mysql named squiddb, and assign it a user/password like:
 create database squiddb;
 GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON squiddb.* TO squid_user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD';
 flush privileges;
 
 d) Populate the squid database with the dump from squiddb.sql like:
 mysql -usquid_user -pPASSWORD squiddb < squiddb.sql
 
 e) Modify the line saying:
 auth_param basic program /usr/local/squid/libexec/squid_db_auth --user squid_user --password PASSWORD --md5 --persist
 in the squid configuration file to match the mysql squid user and password created.
 
 f) Launch Squid.
 
 g) Put the script itself(count_squidsql.py) into a directory from which you'll be running it, like into /root/traficcount_squid and configure the next lines there to match the correct mysql settings:
 login="squid_user"
 password="PASSWORD"
 database="squiddb"
 host_loc="localhost"
 h) Create the next cron jobs:
 * * * * * /root/traficcount_squid/count_squidsql.py -l /usr/local/squid/var/logs/access.log -a parse -s localhost
 0 * * * * /root/traficcount_squid/count_squidsql.py -l /usr/local/squid/var/logs/access.log -a rotate -s localhost
 0 0 1 * * /root/traficcount_squid/count_squidsql.py -l /usr/local/squid/var/logs/access.log -a reset -s localhost
 where the first will be the parsing of the squid log(note the log is /usr/local/squid/var/logs/access.log).
 the second will rotate the parsed log once per hour.
 the third will reset the traffic counters in the mysql database. 

4) Usage.

 Sample usage is:
 Usage:/root/traficcount_squid/count_squidsql.py --logfile/-l [LogFile Path] --action/-a [parse|rotate|reset] --server/-s [servername]
 Where the LogFile Path is the logfile to be parsed.
 The action is parse, rotate or reset where parse will parse the logfile, rotate will rotate the parsed logs and reset will reset the traffic counters.
 The servername is the server where squid is installed, this is done in order to manage more squid servers at once but needs additional configurations. The default will be localhost.
